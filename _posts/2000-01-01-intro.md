The Biomina Lunch Talks are a series of lectures that focus on bioinformatics and medical informatics research, applications, use in the industry, etc. The aim of the sessions is to gather prominent and young researchers in an informal setting where they will have the opportunity to present and discuss ongoing research. As a bonus, despite the adage "*There's no such thing as free lunch.*", we do offer a free sandwich to all attendees.

On this page you will find information about upcoming talks and an overview of previous sessions (including speaker slides).

If you would like to present your own research, suggest other candidate speakers, subscribe to our mailing list or just request more information, don't hesitate to [contact us](#contact).
